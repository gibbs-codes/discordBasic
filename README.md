## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot Not Responding:**
1. Check Discord permissions (Read/Send Messages, Use Slash Commands)
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check MongoDB connection and API key validity
4. Review logs for specific error messages

**Admin Commands Not Working:**
1. Ensure user has admin permissions (role or user ID configured)
2. Try both slash commands and legacy commands
3. Check if bot has necessary Discord permissions
4. Verify slash commands are registered (`/health` should work)

**Memory Context Issues:**
1. Allow time for memory to build (requires multiple interactions)
2. Check MongoDB collections exist and have data
3. Verify memory service initialization in logs
4. Test with `/showmemory` command

**Performance Issues:**
1. Check MongoDB performance and indexing
2. Monitor API rate limits and usage
3. Review memory usage and Node.js performance
4. Consider adjusting cache TTL and memory lookback settings

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs first - they contain detailed error information
2. Run health checks: `npm run test:health`
3. Use `/health` command for system diagnostics
4. Review [Deployment Checklist](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) for setup issues

## üîÑ Migration from Previous Versions

If migrating from a coaching/accountability bot:

1. **Backup existing data** before migration
2. **Run migration script**: `npm run migrate`
3. **Update environment variables** to new format
4. **Test thoroughly** using the integration test suite
5. **Update Discord channel setup** if needed

The migration script preserves existing interaction data and converts it to the new technical workspace format while cleaning up old coaching-specific collections.
